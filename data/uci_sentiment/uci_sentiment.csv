a very very very slow moving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man,negative,imdb
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out,negative,imdb
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non existent,negative,imdb
very little music or anything to speak of,negative,imdb
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head,positive,imdb
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if it's about emptiness it works i guess because it's empty,negative,imdb

it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see,negative,imdb
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made,positive,imdb
i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post production editing directing or any other aspect of film making,positive,imdb
it's practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces,positive,imdb
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 it's quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 this is the number one best th game in the series 1 it deserves strong love 1 it is an insane game 1 there are massive levels massive unlockable characters it's just a massive game 1 waste your money on this game 1 this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 actually the graphics were good at the time 1 today the graphics are crap 0 as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 this game rocks 1 buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 it's pure brilliance 1 this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg 13 film and make a complete non sequel while changing its tone to a pg rated family movie 0 i wasn't the least bit interested 0 not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and i'm not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 but it's just not funny 0 but even the talented carrell can't save this 0 his co stars don't fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue green screen work i've ever seen 0 but whatever it was that cost them so much it didn't translate to quality that's for sure 0 the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 i'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 it's hard not to fall head over heels in love with that girl 1 on the negative it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 long whiny and pointless 0 but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 excellent cast story line performances 1 totally believable 1 anne heche was utterly convincing 1 sam shepard's portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 i was very disappointed in the movie 0 one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 there is a totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene 0 there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they're delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 and quite honestly often its not very good 0 often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 there are some generally great things in it 1 i wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time though 0 the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 i especially liked the non cliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 if you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 alexander nevsky is a great film 1 he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of qu bec,negative,imdb
this if the first movie i've given a 10 to in years,positive,imdb
if there was ever a movie that needed word of mouth to promote this is it,positive,imdb
overall the film is interesting and thought provoking,positive,imdb
plus it was well paced and suited its relatively short run time,positive,imdb
give this one a look,positive,imdb
i gave it a 10,positive,imdb
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted,positive,imdb
it is a true classic,positive,imdb
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b list horror suspense films go,positive,imdb
definitely worth checking out,positive,imdb
the problem was the script,negative,imdb
it was horrendous,negative,imdb
there was nothing believable about it at all,negative,imdb
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were,negative,imdb
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time,positive,imdb
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going,positive,imdb
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip,positive,imdb
ursula burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church,positive,imdb
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good music including a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try,positive,imdb
i don't think you will be disappointed,positive,imdb
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad,negative,imdb
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere,negative,imdb
it was too predictable even for a chick flick,negative,imdb
too politically correct,negative,imdb
very disappointing,negative,imdb
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful,positive,imdb
i love lane but i've never seen her in a movie this lousy,negative,imdb
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back,negative,imdb
but in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold,positive,imdb
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiot savant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch,positive,imdb
the directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good,negative,imdb
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before,negative,imdb
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away,negative,imdb
the directing seems too pretentious,negative,imdb
the scenes with the oh so mature neighbour girl are a misplace,negative,imdb
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode,negative,imdb
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid,negative,imdb
some applause should be given to the prelude however,positive,imdb
i really liked that,positive,imdb
a great film by a great director,positive,imdb
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night,positive,imdb
the music in the film is really nice too,positive,imdb
i'd advise anyone to go and see it,positive,imdb
brilliant,positive,imdb
10 10,positive,imdb
i liked this movie way too much,positive,imdb
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside,negative,imdb
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets,positive,imdb
however this didn't make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie,negative,imdb
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife to be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by,negative,imdb
there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving,negative,imdb
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding,negative,imdb
all in all a great disappointment,negative,imdb
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film,negative,imdb
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing i q,negative,imdb
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on,negative,imdb
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these,negative,imdb
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience,negative,imdb
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict,negative,imdb
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination,negative,imdb
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core,negative,imdb
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life,negative,imdb
you can't relate with them hell you barely can understand them,negative,imdb
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others,positive,imdb
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly,negative,imdb
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film,negative,imdb
a truly truly bad film,negative,imdb
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse,negative,imdb
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder,negative,imdb
i paid too much,negative,imdb
also it's a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse,positive,imdb
it was so boring,negative,imdb
no plot whatsoever,negative,imdb
again no plot at all,negative,imdb
horrible,negative,imdb
worst hour and a half of my life oh my gosh,negative,imdb
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief,negative,imdb
i hate movies like that,negative,imdb
yeah the movie pretty much sucked,negative,imdb
there is no plot or storyline,negative,imdb
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend boyfriend to keep you occupied through out,negative,imdb
awful,negative,imdb
i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much,negative,imdb
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid 7 50 to see this crap,negative,imdb
nobody identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reverse stereotypes,negative,imdb
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actors an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling a picture painted with crayons,negative,imdb
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things,negative,imdb
still i do like this movie for it's empowerment of women there's not enough movies out there like this one,positive,imdb
your brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self preservation,negative,imdb
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and i took a good two hours to fully recover,negative,imdb
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films,negative,imdb
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way,negative,imdb
i mean this in a terrible way,negative,imdb
this film has no redeeming features,negative,imdb
everything is appalling,negative,imdb
artless camera work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable i e,negative,imdb
the story is beyond stupid,negative,imdb
the script is was there a script,negative,imdb
the kids are annoying,negative,imdb
the lead man is charisma free,negative,imdb
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture,negative,imdb
i'll even say it again this is torture,negative,imdb
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity,negative,imdb
not a pleasant voyage of self discovery,negative,imdb
highly unrecommended,negative,imdb
if this premise sound stupid that's because it is,negative,imdb
yes it's that bad,negative,imdb
nothing at all to recommend,negative,imdb
an excellent performance from ms,positive,imdb
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them,positive,imdb
it's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound,positive,imdb
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense,negative,imdb
there were too many close ups,negative,imdb
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom,negative,imdb
but this movie is definitely a below average rent,negative,imdb
you'll love it 1 this movie is bad 0 so bad 0 the film is way too long 0 this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 the movie i received was a great quality film for it's age 1 john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 i really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 i don't think i've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self indulgent piece of junk 0 it probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isn't that noteworthy 0 another thing i didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 his performance is simply genius 1 he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miner's daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire,positive,imdb
in fact it's hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 ray charles is legendary 1 ray charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 hitchcock is a great director 1 ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author living working in a chilly abstruse culture 0 the flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 the character developments also lacked in depth 0 woa talk about awful 0 do not waste your time 0 it was just too horrible 0 the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 the poor actors 0 you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance 0 this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 the film has great actors a master director a significant theme at least a would be significant theme undertone of fifties existential world weariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 regrettably the film fails 0 the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 yet i enjoy watching it 1 unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 the dialogue sucked 0 the cinematography if it can be called that sucked 0 the soundtrack sucked 0 the acting sucked 0 the concert sequences just sucked 0 that was nice 1 that was funny 1 it was so funny 1 overall this movie was cheap trash 0 but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 i came out of it feeling angry 0 spoilers whatever else can or can't be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not state of the art 1 conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy and or fx fans 1 and there wasn't a single sour note struck acting wise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 all things considered a job very well done 1 thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 it ranks highly as a great noir crime drama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 up there with the best of melville 1 everything about this film is simply incredible 1 you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations it's an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 there is a lot of beautiful places 1 it was forced like everything in this movie 0 again lame 0 here's where the movie really pi ed me off 0 and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 summary the witticisms weren't witty 0 the plot well i said i'd let that one go 0 the acting was bad 0 really bad 0 even billy bob couldn't rise above the script which was worse 0 camerawork again bad 0 rating 1 out of 10 0 an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen 1 and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 i couldn't think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anything a work of art 1 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 i literally vomited while watching this film 0 i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls 1 his performance as awarded was stunning 1 the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 all in all a beautiful directed film from nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast 1 i'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5 year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap,negative,imdb
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things,negative,imdb
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well i'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much,negative,imdb
this is such a fun and funny movie,positive,imdb
highly entertaining at all angles,positive,imdb
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts,positive,imdb
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous,positive,imdb
it even has its sweet moments,positive,imdb
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine,positive,imdb
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played,positive,imdb
and i really did find them funny,positive,imdb
this is actually a very smart movie,positive,imdb
there is a brilliant twist ending,positive,imdb
i love it 1 the ending is so so perfect you'll shed a tear 1 i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 i will never forget it now 1 it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 this movie is terrible 0 the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like they're 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 for those that haven't seen it don't waste your time 0 to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters 0 in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all 0 it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off 0 glad i didn't pay to see it 0 didn't laugh or even smile once 0 but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn 0 it is a really good show to watch 1 it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 barney is definitely super de duper 1 is pretty funny 1 babie bop is very cute 1 the kids are very cool too 1 but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies,negative,imdb
it's just lame,negative,imdb
the guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right,negative,imdb
everything about this movie is stupid,negative,imdb
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie,negative,imdb
it is shameful,negative,imdb
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could,positive,imdb
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show these characters were so real,positive,imdb
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again,positive,imdb
now you know why i gave it a 10,positive,imdb
i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories,positive,imdb
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is,positive,imdb
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch,positive,imdb
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other,positive,imdb
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy,positive,imdb
everything from acting to cinematography was solid,positive,imdb
definitely worth checking out,positive,imdb
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen,positive,imdb
this movie has a cutting edge to it,positive,imdb
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him,positive,imdb
the new characters weren't all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who,negative,imdb
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever,negative,imdb
it didn't make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying,negative,imdb
the jerky camera movements were also annoying,negative,imdb
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror,negative,imdb
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot,negative,imdb
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid,negative,imdb
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf,negative,imdb
elias koteas jack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets naked billy drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget,positive,imdb
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay,positive,imdb
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute but if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away,positive,imdb
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times,negative,imdb
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing,negative,imdb
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes,negative,imdb
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back,negative,imdb
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works,positive,imdb
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazing stylized beautiful and effective,positive,imdb
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer,positive,imdb
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art,positive,imdb
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist,positive,imdb
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history,positive,imdb
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of america's own imperial age,positive,imdb
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history,positive,imdb
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connery's noble brigand candace bergen's feisty heroine john huston's wily john hay or steve kanaly's spiffy radiant ruthless can do lieutenant roosevelt's big stick,positive,imdb
this is high adventure at its best,positive,imdb
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real life my father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse,positive,imdb
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt,positive,imdb
my mother and brother had to do this when i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed,positive,imdb
almost all of the songs in cover girl are old fashioned and not very tuneful,negative,imdb
the most annoying thing about 'cover girl' is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal,negative,imdb
unfortunately 'cover girl' is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain,negative,imdb
non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well,positive,imdb
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful,positive,imdb
a good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing,positive,imdb
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job,positive,imdb
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs,positive,imdb
it's a feel good film and that's how i felt when i came out of the cinema,positive,imdb

a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today,positive,imdb
her role was played well,positive,imdb
not too screamy not to masculine but just right,positive,imdb
the camera really likes her in this movie,positive,imdb
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script,positive,imdb
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different,positive,imdb
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad,negative,imdb
even worse than ticker,negative,imdb
that movie was bad,negative,imdb
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh,negative,imdb
it just blew,negative,imdb
this movie is excellent angel is beautiful and scamp is adorable his little yelps when hes scared and the funniest parts are when scamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing 'ive never had this feeling before' i totally recommend this movie its coming out on special edition on june 20 the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid,positive,imdb
i just cant explain this movie more than romantic charming hilarious and adorable the junkyard scenes are funny all the junkyard dogs have something special too funny i laughed kids will love it buy it when it comes out it has new features,positive,imdb
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda,negative,imdb
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich s to be admitted elsewhere,negative,imdb
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round,negative,imdb
i wish i could enter negative values admins,negative,imdb
the sets are so bad they wouldn't look out of place on a thunderbirds episode,negative,imdb
the use of slow motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity,negative,imdb
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too,negative,imdb
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it,negative,imdb
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if i'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie,negative,imdb
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film,negative,imdb
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell,negative,imdb
1 10 and only because there is no setting for 0 10,negative,imdb
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut bag side note i'd love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones,positive,imdb
the soundtrack wasn't terrible either,positive,imdb
but the acting even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon was terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimp like and the camera work barely tolerable,negative,imdb
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oy vey scale,positive,imdb
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation,negative,imdb
both do good jobs and are quite amusing,positive,imdb
but the convoluted plot just didn't convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance,negative,imdb
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it,negative,imdb
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well,positive,imdb
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines,negative,imdb
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie,negative,imdb
i like armand assante my cable company's summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again,positive,imdb
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends,positive,imdb
my 8 10 score is mostly for the plot,positive,imdb
i won't say any more i don't like spoilers so i don't want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time,positive,imdb
wow what a bad film,negative,imdb
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible,negative,imdb
the plot doesn't hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling,negative,imdb
not even good for camp value,negative,imdb
i wasn't expecting oscar material but this,negative,imdb
you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming,negative,imdb
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the movie going public,negative,imdb
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative,negative,imdb
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because there's nothing lower,negative,imdb
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed,negative,imdb
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script,negative,imdb
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable,negative,imdb
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them,negative,imdb
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the u s,negative,imdb
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving,negative,imdb
the only thing worse than taylor's acting was stanwyck's singing,negative,imdb
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely,negative,imdb
i was deeply impressed with the character he played,positive,imdb
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor,positive,imdb
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo,negative,imdb
even the squibs look awful,negative,imdb
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america,negative,imdb
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing,negative,imdb
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time,negative,imdb
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all,negative,imdb
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense,negative,imdb
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words,negative,imdb
the directing is sloppy at best,negative,imdb
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing,negative,imdb
of course the acting is blah,negative,imdb
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting,negative,imdb
and finally after all that we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell,negative,imdb
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other,positive,imdb
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago,positive,imdb
this movie contained an all star cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i haven't seen before,positive,imdb
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it,positive,imdb
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1 10 scale,positive,imdb
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must have,positive,imdb
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning,negative,imdb
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs,negative,imdb
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it,positive,imdb
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way,positive,imdb
but this movie really got to me,positive,imdb
see it,positive,imdb
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style,positive,imdb
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesn't understand where he is what he is doing and why,positive,imdb
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006,positive,imdb
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting,positive,imdb
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me,positive,imdb
later i found myself lost in the power of the film,positive,imdb
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film,positive,imdb
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race,positive,imdb
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance,positive,imdb
the rest of the cast also play well,positive,imdb
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers,positive,imdb
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts,negative,imdb
about half way through this film i started to dislike it,negative,imdb
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it,negative,imdb
what this film lacks is a convincing script,negative,imdb
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed,negative,imdb
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it,negative,imdb
the cast is good,positive,imdb
for that it's worth checking out,positive,imdb
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life,negative,imdb
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen,negative,imdb
everything about it is just bad,negative,imdb
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season,negative,imdb
the script is bad very bad it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc 17 movie,negative,imdb
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period,negative,imdb
final word this show is a real torture,negative,imdb
it is zillion times away from reality,negative,imdb
watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show,negative,imdb
rating 0 10 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show,negative,imdb
20th century fox's road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie,negative,imdb
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more,negative,imdb
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical,negative,imdb
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing,negative,imdb
and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors,negative,imdb
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me,negative,imdb
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment,negative,imdb
there are so many problems i dont know where to start,negative,imdb
the cast was great,positive,imdb
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle aged upper class uptight white guy,positive,imdb
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well,positive,imdb
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes,negative,imdb
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone,negative,imdb
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs,negative,imdb
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa's character,negative,imdb
there is no real plot,negative,imdb
i wouldnt see this movie again for free,negative,imdb
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history,positive,imdb
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous film mostly because it was so ground breaking,positive,imdb
while you don't yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928,positive,imdb
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is,positive,imdb
it's just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way,positive,imdb
clever and a real crowd pleaser this film still ranks among mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years,positive,imdb
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luv's diaper commercial is completely unconvincing,negative,imdb
i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there,negative,imdb
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece,positive,imdb
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada lee and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen james wong howe,positive,imdb
i don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake,negative,imdb
this may be the only bad film he ever made,negative,imdb
so bad well it's just bad,negative,imdb
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way,negative,imdb
it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this,negative,imdb
i thought it was bad,negative,imdb
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable,negative,imdb
let's start with all the problems the acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad,negative,imdb
the script is a big flawed mess,negative,imdb
the best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite,negative,imdb
director paul matthews who also wrote directed the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesn't know how to pace his films,negative,imdb
the movie is terribly boring in places,negative,imdb
the lighting is awful,negative,imdb
the film looks cheap and bland,negative,imdb
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore,negative,imdb
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesn't work here,negative,imdb
the visual effects were awful,negative,imdb
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god's sake,negative,imdb
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful,negative,imdb
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so i'll give credit where credit's due the creature effects were actually pretty cool,positive,imdb
gotta love those close ups of slimy drooling teeth,positive,imdb
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus,negative,imdb
not recommended,negative,imdb
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing,negative,imdb
aside from it's terrible lead this film has loads of other debits,negative,imdb
i understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive,negative,imdb
lewis black's considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg 13 rating certainly won't allow,negative,imdb
the film's sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim,positive,imdb
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer,negative,imdb
the budget was evidently very limited,negative,imdb
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the below par script which borrowed much from the earlier classic,negative,imdb
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up,negative,imdb
filmiing was less expansive,negative,imdb
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original,negative,imdb
generally it just lacked imagination,negative,imdb
not recommended,negative,imdb
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this,negative,imdb
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place,negative,imdb
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep,negative,imdb
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period,negative,imdb
i can't believe there's even a sequel to this,negative,imdb
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review,negative,imdb
being a 90's child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons,positive,imdb
but tiny toons kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created,positive,imdb
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show,positive,imdb
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers,positive,imdb
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character,positive,imdb
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead,positive,imdb
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through,negative,imdb
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk,negative,imdb
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera,positive,imdb
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done,negative,imdb
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie,negative,imdb
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles,negative,imdb
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish,negative,imdb
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense,negative,imdb
the story line is just awful,negative,imdb
it's just painful,negative,imdb
and the accents are absolutely abysmal,negative,imdb
there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit,negative,imdb
don't waste your time watching this rubbish non researched film,negative,imdb
i believe that pitch black was done well,positive,imdb
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it,positive,imdb
go watch it,positive,imdb
omit watching this,negative,imdb
very funny,positive,imdb
my rating just 3 out of 10,negative,imdb
the characters are interesting and you really care for them,positive,imdb
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits,positive,imdb
don't miss it,positive,imdb
this is a masterful piece of film making with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian self indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self sacrifice and more,positive,imdb
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it,positive,imdb
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close up camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold,positive,imdb
it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work,positive,imdb
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew,negative,imdb
regardless the film fails on most levels,negative,imdb
avoid at all costs,negative,imdb
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was,positive,imdb
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor,positive,imdb
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic,positive,imdb
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child,positive,imdb
but it wasn't until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was,positive,imdb
i'll give this film 10 out of 10,positive,imdb
i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull,negative,imdb
he really didn't seem to want to be hosting his voice overs were monotonous didn't get involved with the guests,negative,imdb
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists,positive,imdb
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcock's black and white low budget original,positive,imdb
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable,positive,imdb
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film,positive,imdb
excellently produced by one of sci fi's best producers scot vandiver,positive,imdb
but it is entertaining nonetheless,positive,imdb
it's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch,positive,imdb
there's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts,positive,imdb
the cast is always entertaining as usual,positive,imdb
overall a delight,positive,imdb
this movie is so mind bendingly awful it couldn't have even been created,negative,imdb
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself,negative,imdb
the least said about the acting the better,negative,imdb
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa,positive,imdb
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process,positive,imdb
nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film,positive,imdb
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see,positive,imdb
don't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 10 10,positive,imdb
excellent performance,positive,imdb
there still are good actors around,positive,imdb
also great directing and photography,positive,imdb
very true to shakespear and a 'must' for all shakespear fans,positive,imdb
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle out he gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting,positive,imdb
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil,positive,imdb
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one,positive,imdb
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upa's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award,positive,imdb
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon,positive,imdb
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex,positive,imdb
also notable is john bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppola's dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar,positive,imdb
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of mini series this is baaaaaad,negative,imdb
unless you're just out to visually collect all extant films of austen's work you can skip this one,negative,imdb
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles,positive,imdb
it is not good,negative,imdb
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy,negative,imdb
then the film just dropped the ball,negative,imdb
this is a stunning movie,positive,imdb
raw and sublimely moving,positive,imdb
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences,positive,imdb
all of the main players are mesmerising,positive,imdb
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike,positive,imdb
julian fellowes has triumphed again,positive,imdb
he's a national treasure,positive,imdb
go and see it,positive,imdb
this is an excellent film,positive,imdb
the aerial scenes were well done,positive,imdb
it was also the right balance of war and love,positive,imdb
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few,positive,imdb
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference,positive,imdb
a good film by a great director,positive,imdb
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage,positive,imdb
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joe's glasses the one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene,negative,imdb
this is just a great movie,positive,imdb
10 out of 10 stars,positive,imdb
i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection,negative,imdb
it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason,negative,imdb
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema,positive,imdb
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other,positive,imdb
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films,positive,imdb
i advise you to look out for it,positive,imdb
you wont regret it,positive,imdb
highly recommended a,positive,imdb
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is,negative,imdb
it's a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage,negative,imdb
it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable',negative,imdb
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time,negative,imdb
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes,negative,imdb
how awful she is,negative,imdb
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures,negative,imdb
the results well are a shame,negative,imdb
delete this film from your mind,negative,imdb
one of the worst shows of all time,negative,imdb
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for,negative,imdb
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the bad ass girl who are these actors,negative,imdb
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part,negative,imdb
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show,negative,imdb
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors,negative,imdb
lame would be the best way to describe it,negative,imdb
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens' christmas carol in its sensibility,positive,imdb
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character,positive,imdb
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye pleasing gem,positive,imdb
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any self respecting rpger there is,negative,imdb
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong,negative,imdb

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever,negative,imdb
that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary time waster of a film,negative,imdb
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen,negative,imdb
it isn't even an achievement as a so bad it's good or so bad it's memorable movie,negative,imdb
it's an empty hollow shell of a movie,negative,imdb
seriously it's not worth wasting your or your kid's time on,negative,imdb
avoid avoid avoid,negative,imdb

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family,positive,imdb
it's one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tv never mind the fact that i already have it memorized,positive,imdb
nothing new there,negative,imdb
that was done in the second movie,negative,imdb
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy,negative,imdb
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted,negative,imdb
what on earth is irons doing in this film,negative,imdb
i just saw this film and i recommend it,positive,imdb
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good,positive,imdb
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love,positive,imdb
tom wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering,positive,imdb
emily watson's character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything,positive,imdb
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie,positive,imdb
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruise's attempt,positive,imdb
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene,positive,imdb

the football scenes at the end were perplexing,negative,imdb
but i thought his acting was skilled,positive,imdb
meredith m was better than all right,positive,imdb
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart,positive,imdb

nine out of ten for a truly lovely film,positive,imdb
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub genre,positive,imdb
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70's,positive,imdb
a standout scene,positive,imdb
this scene is very strong and unpleasant,negative,imdb
technically the film is well made with impressive camera work solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill,positive,imdb
it's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema,positive,imdb
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end,positive,imdb
i liked the way dustin hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son,positive,imdb
this movie is also revealing,positive,imdb
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue,positive,imdb
and it was boring,negative,imdb
i am so tired of clich s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast,negative,imdb
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up,positive,imdb
it's a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect,positive,imdb
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and that's right,positive,imdb
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star,positive,imdb
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself,positive,imdb
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating,positive,imdb
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score i've ever heard,positive,imdb
you won't forget this movie,positive,imdb
why was this film made,negative,imdb
the film has an ultra cheap look to it,negative,imdb
the result is a film that just don't look right,negative,imdb
none of them are engaging or exciting,negative,imdb
the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it,negative,imdb
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time,negative,imdb
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it,positive,imdb

this movie is so awesome,positive,imdb
i loved it it was really scary,positive,imdb
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there,positive,imdb
if you want a real scare rent this one,positive,imdb
10 10,positive,imdb
this is an extraordinary film,positive,imdb
as a courtroom drama it's compelling as an indictment on the american justice system it's frightening,positive,imdb
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court,positive,imdb
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries i've seen,positive,imdb
this mostly routine fact based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole,positive,imdb
predictable but not a bad watch,positive,imdb
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part,positive,imdb
she carries the movie well,positive,imdb
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations,positive,imdb
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd,positive,imdb
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etc it's all wrong,negative,imdb
in fact this stinker smells like a direct to video release,negative,imdb
avoid at all costs,negative,imdb
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series,negative,imdb
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain,negative,imdb
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards,negative,imdb
the only place good for this film is in the garbage,negative,imdb
the worst one of the series,negative,imdb
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion,positive,imdb
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions,positive,imdb
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way,positive,imdb
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film,positive,imdb
this film offers many delights and surprises,positive,imdb
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film,positive,imdb
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch,positive,imdb
you share general loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor,positive,imdb
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression,positive,imdb
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop,positive,imdb
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars,positive,imdb
the acting as you'd expect from this cast is top notch,positive,imdb
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic,positive,imdb
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violin playing anatomist doctor quinn,positive,imdb
conclusion i loved it,positive,imdb
it's a long time since i was so entertained by a movie,positive,imdb
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it,positive,imdb
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line,positive,imdb
it's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time,positive,imdb
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism,positive,imdb
plus with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job,positive,imdb
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south,positive,imdb
trumbull on i love lucy,positive,imdb
see it with your kids if you have a chance it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years,positive,imdb
see both films if you can,positive,imdb
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyce's acclaimed novella the dead,positive,imdb
feelings thoughts gabriel's discomfort during the dance all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in huston's portrayal,positive,imdb
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist,negative,imdb
it's very slow,negative,imdb
lot of holes in the plot there's nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age,negative,imdb
don't waste your time,negative,imdb
end of days is one of the worst big budget action movies i've ever seen,negative,imdb
he surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money,negative,imdb
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen,negative,imdb
i'm still trying to get over how bad it was,negative,imdb
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever,positive,imdb
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if you're looking for the be all end all of brainsucking movies look no further,positive,imdb
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i can't recommend this movie enough 1 call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 lots of holes in the script 0 it's like a bad two hour tv movie 0 now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 the dialogue is atrocious 0 the acting is beyond abysmal 0 everything stinks 0 trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 worse there's an incredibly weak sub plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 it's dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 in short don't bother with this movie 0 i won't spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 the best scene in the movie is at the end but i won't spoil it 1 if there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it's distorted interpretations of fame 1 a film not easily forgotten 1 but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 great movie 1 also the story and acting were weak 0 at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 8 15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasn't 0 either way it sucks 0 the script is horrendously stupid 0 the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest 0 everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 what the hell kind of crap is that 0 then there's the plot holes 0 you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 she's poised and amazing 1 dee snider just plain sucks 0 he can't act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he can't write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fails miserably 0 this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 avoid at any and all costs 0 at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 avoid this film at all costs 0 i don't know what happened in season five what a mess 0 the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 now this is a movie i really dislike 0 it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks 0 the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f x are terrible 0 i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 the best part about nurse betty is it's unpredictability,positive,imdb
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next,positive,imdb
otherwise don't even waste your time on this,negative,imdb
this one just fails to create any real suspense,negative,imdb
as for the killer don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening,negative,imdb
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film,positive,imdb
i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone,negative,imdb
one of the most boring pointless movies i have ever seen,negative,imdb
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying,negative,imdb

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad,negative,imdb
characters are one dimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys,negative,imdb

i rate this movie 9 10,positive,imdb
i do not know if this was emilio estevez's directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye,positive,imdb
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie,positive,imdb
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord,positive,imdb
for readers who have already seen one of miyazaki's films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience,positive,imdb

the story is also both funny and poignant at times,positive,imdb
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie,positive,imdb
this is truly an art movie it actually has a lot of art in it,positive,imdb
go rent it,positive,imdb
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again,positive,imdb
it's the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher it's meanings,positive,imdb
brilliance indeed,positive,imdb
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think you'll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you,positive,imdb
think of the film being like a dream,positive,imdb
simply beautiful,positive,imdb
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract,positive,imdb
it's a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver,positive,imdb
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives,positive,imdb
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic,negative,imdb

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film,positive,imdb
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters,positive,imdb
definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness,positive,imdb
hayao miyazaki's latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood,positive,imdb
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney pixar's cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories,positive,imdb
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film,positive,imdb
the art style has the appearance of crayon pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful,positive,imdb
if you act in such a film you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible,negative,imdb
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere,negative,imdb
if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time,negative,imdb
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost,positive,imdb
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses,positive,imdb
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting,negative,imdb
