honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad

and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retardbe a king think not why be a king when you can be a god,2013.0,0.0,rap,Hip-Hop
